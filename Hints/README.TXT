Here are the complete HINT SHEETS to all the Scott Adams adventures,
published by Adventure International.  These are not "walk-throughs" --
they don't give away the game -- instead, for each puzzle in the game,
they give a clue, a bigger clue, and a solution.  A simple system is
used to keep you from reading any clues you don't want to see yet.

Also in here is the code "key" that is used at the very end of Savage
Island, Part II (Adventure #11).  At the end of that adventure, you will
get a message in code which you use this "key" to decipher.  Don't
look at the key until you've finished the game.

The files here are:

HINT.1, ..., HINT.14, HINT.Q1, ..., HINT.Q3
    Hint sheets for Adventure #1, ... #14 and Questprobe #1, ... #3.
    Print the hint sheet for the game you're playing on your printer.
    Each hint sheet consists of a series of hints, three for each
    place in the Adventure you might get stuck.  Find the puzzle
    you're having trouble with, and use the dictionary at the end
    of the hint sheet to read the hints.

SAVAGE.COD
    Code "key" for the coded message given at the end of Savage
    Island, Part II.  The "key" consists of the lines of a story
    whose order has been scrambled.  The message will tell you
    what order to put the lines in.  NOTHING in the story will
    help you at all with solving the Adventure (trust me!), so
    please don't ruin the story for yourself by trying to decode it.

The Scott Adams Adventures are:

#1 - Adventureland      \  These are the best games for a new player to
#2 - Pirate Adventure   /   start with.  Pirate is a true classic.
#3 - Secret Mission (a.k.a. Mission Impossible)  Not impossible, just hard.
#4 - Voodoo Castle
#5 - The Count
#6 - Strange Odyssey       Quite difficult.
#7 - Mystery Fun House     Full of puzzles; this one is challenging.
#8 - Pyramid of Doom
#9 - Ghost Town
#10 - Savage Island Part 1  \  These form one Adventure.  Very tough but
#11 - Savage Island Part 2  /   absolutely unforgettable once you solve it.
#12 - Golden Voyage        Not as difficult as most; this one isn't by Scott.
#13 - Sorcerer of Claymorgue Castle
#14 - Return to Pirate's Island

The Questprobe series consists of:

#1 - The Hulk         \  Three games based on Marvel Comics
#2 - Spiderman        /  characters
#3 - Fantastic Four  /

I have added the missing hints for Questprobe 2 and 3, so now this
archive includes the hints to all 17 Scott Adams adventures.  (Well,
almost --- I don't know whether there ever was a hint sheet for 
"Buckaroo Banzai".)   I have also corrected a few typos.  Enjoy!
